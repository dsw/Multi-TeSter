                 Documentation for mts: Multi-TeSter

Multi-TeSter, mts, implements a domain-specific language, MTS, for
generating and running multiple modes of similar tests from a single
source.

  1) For each mode MTS runs a command line and then checks that the
     expected exit code, stdout, and stderr result, failing if they do
     not.

  2) An MTS input file can have multiple modes and all of the above
     aspects of running the program being tested can depend on the
     current mode; this feature allows multiple very similar tests to
     be expressed in one file, re-using their commonality.

Run MTS as follows:

  mts [FLAGS] FILE.mts

This documentation is embedded in MTS at the end; to get MTS to print
this documentation, type:

  mts --help
